Todo:
- Docking and/or anchoring of the images to the sides of the screen

Need help with:
- I am terrible with graphical design, so I would love to have someone work on the Advanced Settings form
- The picture packs are something I've cropped up in a few minutes using Paint.NET. Feel free to send me your own so I can bundle them in the application
- Any code design improvements are welcome. I am working on this when I have the time (and I don't :) ) so if you smell bad code, please let me know


Ideas for the future:
- handle animated images (how?)
?- sometimes AlwaysOnTop doesn't work
- other parameters syntax @property="value"
- monitor for CPU temp (how?)
- Pinky & the Brain theme
- list of active applications on which to hide
- Full screen images that frame the screen like picture frames (green vines that flower, Giger style stuff, etc)
	- that also means a feature to resize the images based on fixed values or current screen size
- make the code look decent, write documentation for it
- opacity controlled by configurable modules (maybe also other parameters, like position or dock)
- image provider modules
